# [Travel Journal using `ReactJS`](https://travel-journal-taupe.vercel.app/)

# About
A travel journal created using ` create-react-app` to practice ` Components ` in ` ReactJS`. This is about the places that I have visited. Infromation related to each place such as _place name_, _country_, _description_, _image_ and its _google map link_ has been included for that particular place. The infromation that is stored in ` data.js` file in form of _array of objects_. All the infromation is being retrieved dynamically using ` props`. During this project, whate I've learnt is ` Props`, `dynamicallt creating Components`, ` Reusability of created components` and much more abut ` ReactJS`. For styling of the project,  [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) has been used. After creating this project, It has been deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/login?next=%2Fd-hizabi-programmer%2Fsaniya-memon).
